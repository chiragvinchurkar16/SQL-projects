 Library Management System Database Project-2
--1)This project aimed to create a database schema for a library management system,
--allowing the tracking of books, authors, patrons, and borrowing history.
--2)The schema includes four main tables: Books, Authors, Patrons, and BorrowHistory,
--each have their specific purpose in managing library operations.
--3)The Books table stores details of each book,including title, author ID, ISBN, and availability.
--It serves as the central repository for book information in the library.
--4)The Authors table contains information about authors, including their name, birthdate, and nationality.
--5)The Patrons table stores details of library patrons, including their name and phone number.
--It facilitates the management of library members and their interactions with the library system.
--6)The BorrowHistory table tracks the borrowing and return history of books by patrons.
--It records the book ID, patron ID, borrowed date, and returned date for each transaction.

--In this project we implemented various SQL queries to perform various operations on the database,
--such as adding new books, updating book details, searching for books by title, author, or ISBN,
--and tracking book borrowing history.
--The queries such as basic SQL statements, including INSERT, UPDATE, SELECT, and JOIN,
--as well as advanced concepts such as window functions, common table expressions (CTEs), and the MERGE statement.

--This project provides a foundation for managing library operations efficiently using a relational database system.
--It allows library administrators to maintain accurate records of books, authors, patrons, and borrowing history,
--enabling effective library management and providing valuable insights into library usage patterns.
