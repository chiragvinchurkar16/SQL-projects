 Inventory Management System Database Project-1
 In this project, 
1)we have created a database called "InventoryManagement_Products_sql" to manage product inventory. 
2)We have designed and created tables for database "InventoryManagement_Products_sql" products, suppliers,
and inventory transactions,and inserted sample data into each table.
3)We have also demonstrated how to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations 
on these tables using SQL queries.
4)We have 'INSERTED' records into the tables, 'UPDATED' existing records, and 'DELETED' records as needed.
5)we have implemented SQL queries to retrieve(SELECT) and display product information, supplier details, and inventory levels.
6)We have used JOIN statements to combine data from multiple tables 
and applied filtering and sorting options to retrieve specific subsets of data.

--Overall, this project provides a foundation for managing inventory data in a relational database using SQL.
--It demonstrates fundamental SQL concepts such as table creation, data insertion, querying, and data manipulation.
